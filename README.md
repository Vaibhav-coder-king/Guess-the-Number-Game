# 🎮 Guess the Number Game (CLI Version)

Welcome to the **Guess the Number Game** — a simple and fun command-line game built with Python. The game randomly selects a number within a range you specify, and your job is to guess it with hints along the way.

## ✨ Features

- User-defined range input
- Difficulty level detection (Easy, Moderate, Hard, Very Hard)
- Smart hints based on guess proximity (e.g., *Too high*, *Too low*, *It's close*)
- ASCII-art titles using `pyfiglet`
- Input validation and retry options

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pyfiglet` module

Install `pyfiglet` using pip if you don’t have it:

pip install pyfiglet

# 🕹️ Game Flow
Input a starting and ending integer value.

The program calculates difficulty based on the range.

You guess numbers until you get it right.

Hints help you adjust your guesses.

You can choose to play again or exit.
